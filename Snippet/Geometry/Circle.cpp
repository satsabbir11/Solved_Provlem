Distance: sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)
Check if 3 points are in same line:
x1*(y2-y3)-x2(y1-y3)+x3(y1-y2) = 0
Find a circle that covers 2 given:
x3 = (x1+x2)/2 , y3 = (y1+y2)/2
r = dist(x1,y1,x2,y2)
Lattice Points:1+gcd(|x1-x2|,|y1-y2|)
Slope formed by 2 points:(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
Area of sector of circle: Â½ r^2*theta
Arc Length: r*thetha
